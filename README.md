## 🛠️ Game Mechanics

### ① Car Attributes
- **Horsepower (HP)** → Determines top speed.
- **Acceleration** → Time to reach top speed.
- **Grip** → Influences handling and cornering.
- **Weight** → Affects both acceleration and braking.

### ② Heat System
- Win races to **increase heat**.
- Higher heat = **more police attention**, but also **bigger race rewards**.
- Visit the **Chop Shop** to reduce heat (for a price).

### ③ Loans & Debt
- Borrow from the **Loan Shark** if you’re short on cash.
- Repay with **interest** or risk consequences.
